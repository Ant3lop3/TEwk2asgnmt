This is my second assignment project set by the TechEducators

Reflection:

I have mixed feelings about this project of mine. On one hand, I was happy with some of the features I had set, such as the background audio, the horizontal scroll bar and the onload function. However, I have number of gripes with creating this that I need to try and iron out for the future.

To address the absence of the srcset. I choose to set an auto height and width sizing feature as I thought at the time this would be a good idea. Being that if the viewport size was that of an iPhone 12 or desktop it would simply self-adjust. Now this did work, however, the biggest issue I had was when the viewport was shrunk to a smaller size there would be a fair amount of space top and bottom (as I’m using landscape images). I tried to work round this by simply not putting anything in this blank space, so that the image could expand without pushing anything there.

I also tried to stick with the grid method of positioning things around. This wasn’t too bad but at times got very frustrating. Mainly due to the fact that again when expanding the viewport, the grid cells would also enlarge, this in turn spacing everything out which I didn’t want. An example of this was the buttons. Its fine in iPhone size, however in desktop is too far over to the left. At this point it felt as though without drastically changing this set up I would have to leave it where it was for now. 
Ultimately my biggest frustration seems to be positioning elements on screen and complying with various viewport sizes, without moving it self or other elements. It’s as if 75% of my time is getting this to work, especially when I add more and more elements on screen. I wanted to use the grid method universally across all elements as much as I could. I figured if I had an element that just acted like a grid to map the whole page, then child elements to that would then follow this grid rule. This worked for the most part. 

I’m maybe beginning to see why websites will have a desktop version, and then a completely different version for a phone. I would be interested to see how it works, however, I would imagine this would take double the work as effectively you're making the same website twice. I believe more practice is required of me to get the knack of positioning. 
I used a lot of comments in this to help me remember what certain parts of the code do. This is so it can help me later on when I decide to revert back to this as a reference for when I make another site.
Regarding the functions I feel as though this is going to take me quite a few attempts to learn, and implement in websites. At the moment what is alien to me is combining elements from my website whether that’s media such as; videos, photos or audio and combining that in a function. 

When I make functions on Codewars, these feel so much different than the functions that are made via the JS on my website. I feel as though it’s a lot easier making a function when you’re told for example; to take an input of text of some kind, manipulate it and return the output. But I struggle to get my head around manipulating elements which aren’t in a traditional text format. Like images for example, then manipulating those images to return a particular image. I guess this is something that will come in time and practice which I’ll get used to.
